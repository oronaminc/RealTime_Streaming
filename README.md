# Beaglebone-Webcam-Streaming-Server
### Python, OpenCV and Flask implementation of a Beaglebone Black video/webcam streaming server
In this repository you can find a simple implementation of a webcam/video streaming server based on Beaglebone Black.
##### Theory and Background
The implementation borrows a lot from these two sources:
* [Video Streaming with Flask](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/video-streaming-with-flask)
* [kyatou/python-opencv_tutorial](https://github.com/kyatou/python-opencv_tutorial)

##### Hardware
The following hardware are used:
* Beaglebone Black A5A
* Logitech, Inc. Webcam C170
* Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5370 Wireless Adapter (not exactly relevant to this codebase)
* Genesys Logic, Inc. Hub
##### Hardware Setup
All hardware configuration steps, and the Linux image, are available [here](https://github.com/itsasimulation/Beaglebone-Black-Config/tree/master)
